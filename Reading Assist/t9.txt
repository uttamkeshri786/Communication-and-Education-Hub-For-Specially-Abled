Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are,
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky, twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
I’m a little teapot, short and stout
Here’s my handle (place hand on hip)
Here’s my spout (stick your other arm out straight)
When I get all steamed up, hear me shout
Just tip me over and pour me out (lean over with your spout arm)
